REPLIT BUILD PROMPT (COPY/PASTE)

Role: You are a senior full-stack engineer and product architect.
Goal: Build a scalable MVP for a local restaurant discovery and marketing platform using a React frontend, a Node/Express backend deployed on Render, and Supabase as the primary database and authentication provider.

1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Build a Treasure Coast Restaurants MVP that replicates the current public-facing design of https://treasurecoastrestaurants.com/
 while introducing a modern backend architecture that supports:

Restaurant listings & discovery

Restaurant subscriptions (tiered plans)

Patron opt-in for offers (email + SMS)

Curated SMS campaigns

Offer submissions

Usage tracking (SMS + physical credits)

Admin & restaurant dashboards (MVP scope)

This MVP must be usable immediately and extensible for:

iOS / Android app

Additional marketing channels

Advanced analytics

2. TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS
Frontend

React (Vite or Next.js)

Tailwind CSS (or CSS modules if needed for pixel precision)

Responsive, mobile-first

Fonts, spacing, layout, and visual hierarchy should closely match the current WordPress site

Recreate:

Homepage layout

Header/nav placement

Restaurant listing cards

Buttons, hover styles, typography scale

Section spacing and imagery patterns

Backend

Node.js + Express

Deployed on Render

Acts as an API layer between frontend and Supabase

Handles:

Auth validation

Business logic

Rate limiting

Stripe + Twilio webhooks

Database & Auth

Supabase

PostgreSQL database

Supabase Auth (email/password for restaurants & admins)

Row Level Security (RLS)

All core data must live in Supabase (not WordPress)

Integrations

Stripe (subscriptions + metered add-ons)

Twilio (SMS campaigns, STOP handling)

Email provider (SendGrid/Postmark)

3. BRAND & DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL)

Use the existing Treasure Coast Restaurants branding as reference.

Brand cues:

Coastal, local, lifestyle-oriented

Friendly but authoritative

Not overly “techy”

Logo reference:

Use the provided logo file:
/mnt/data/tclifestyle-logo-high-res-color-white-letters.png

Color palette (approximate from logo):

Primary blue (nav, headers, accents)

Warm gold / sand tones (CTAs, highlights)

White backgrounds

Light coastal blues for section breaks

Design rules:

Match button shapes, spacing, and alignment from the current site

Preserve content density (not too sparse)

Use real placeholder imagery styled like food/restaurant photography

Avoid SaaS-looking dashboards on public pages

4. CORE MVP FEATURES TO BUILD
A. Public Pages (Frontend)

Homepage

Hero section

Restaurant discovery CTA

Categories / cuisines

Featured restaurants

“Get local deals” opt-in section

Restaurant Directory

Search + filter (location, cuisine)

Restaurant cards

Individual restaurant profile pages

Deals / Offers Landing Page

Explains SMS/email deals

Opt-in form with consent language

Restaurant Marketing Page

Explains plans (Digital, Silver, Gold, Platinum)

CTA to sign up or book a call

B. Patron Offer + SMS Flow (MVP)

Patron opt-in form:

Phone number

City/ZIP

Cuisine interests

Consent checkbox (TCPA-compliant)

Store:

Consent timestamp

Preferences

Admin can trigger curated SMS campaigns

Twilio integration:

STOP handling

Delivery status logging

No restaurant-initiated SMS in MVP.

C. Restaurant Portal (MVP)

Authenticated dashboard for restaurant owners:

View subscription tier

View usage:

SMS placements remaining

Printing/signage credits remaining

Submit:

Offers (title, description, expiration)

Upload:

Logo

Photos

View:

Podcast schedule

Radio ad status (basic)

Edit:

Basic listing info

Keep UI clean and simple.

D. Admin Dashboard (MVP)

Admin-only access:

View all restaurants

View patron opt-ins

Approve offers

Trigger SMS campaigns

View usage metrics

Adjust restaurant limits manually

5. DATABASE SCHEMA (INITIAL)

Create Supabase tables for:

users (auth)

restaurants

restaurant_plans

subscriptions

offers

patrons

patron_preferences

sms_campaigns

sms_logs

usage_counters

print_credits

Use foreign keys and timestamps everywhere.

Enable Row Level Security so:

Restaurants only see their own data

Patrons never see other patrons

Admins see everything

6. PAYMENT & BILLING (MVP)

Stripe subscriptions for plans

Usage-based add-ons:

Additional SMS

Additional print credits

Webhooks handled via backend on Render

Store subscription status in Supabase

7. DELIVERABLE EXPECTATIONS

The output should include:

A running React frontend

A working Node/Express backend

A connected Supabase project

Seed data for demo restaurants

Clear instructions:

Environment variables

How to run locally

How to deploy to Render

Code structured for:

Easy feature expansion

Mobile app reuse later

8. IMPORTANT MVP CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT over-engineer

Focus on:

Discovery

Offers

Subscriptions

Admin-triggered SMS only

Restaurant dashboards must be usable but minimal

Design fidelity to current site is more important than fancy animations

9. FINAL INSTRUCTION

Build this as a real product MVP, not a demo.

Assume this will be used by:

Real restaurants

Real patrons

Within 30–60 days

Favor:

Stability

Clarity

Scalability
